    <p>Aloo paratha is a paratha stuffed with potato filling. It is traditionally eaten for breakfast. It is made using unleavened dough rolled with a mixture of mashed potato and spices which is cooked on a hot tawa with butter or ghee. Aloo paratha is usually served with butter, chutney, curd, or Indian pickles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>For dough</h4>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        <li>Salt (a pinch)</li>
        <h3>For the potato filling</h3>
        <li>2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt.
            Gradually add water and knead the flour to form a smooth and firm dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, chopped onions (if using), green chilies, grated ginger, cumin seeds, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and chopped coriander leaves.
            Combine all the ingredients well to form the filling mixture.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls, slightly larger than a golf ball.
            Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly. Dust it with flour and roll it out into a small circle, around 4-5 inches in diameter.
            Place a portion of the potato filling (about 2-3 tablespoons) onto the center of the rolled-out dough.</li>
        <li>Gather the edges of the dough around the filling, sealing it completely to form a stuffed ball.
            Flatten the stuffed ball slightly with your palms, then dust it with flour and carefully roll it out into a larger circle, about 7-8 inches in diameter. Be gentle to avoid the filling from coming out.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or tawa over medium heat.
            Once hot, place the rolled-out paratha on the griddle.
            Cook for about a minute until you see small bubbles forming on the surface. Flip the paratha.</li>
        <li>Spread a little ghee or oil on the cooked side of the paratha.
            Flip again and apply ghee or oil on the other side as well.
            Press gently with a spatula and cook until both sides are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Repeat the rolling, stuffing, and cooking process with the remaining dough balls and potato filling.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the aloo parathas to a plate.
            Serve hot with yogurt, pickle, or chutney.</li>
    </ol>
