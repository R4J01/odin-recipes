    <p>Paneer, also known as ponir, is a fresh acid-set cheese common in cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>For Paneer Marinade</h4>
        <li>250g paneer (cottage cheese), cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, and oil to make a paste.
            Gently coat the paneer cubes with this marinade. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked cashew nuts and blend them into a smooth paste with a little water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
            Add the marinated paneer cubes and lightly fry them until they turn golden on all sides. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted, add chopped onions.
            Sauté the onions until they turn translucent.
            Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté for another minute.
            Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.
            </li>
        <li>Allow the tomato-onion mixture to cool down a bit, then transfer it to a blender.
            Blend into a smooth puree. You can add a little water if needed.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add another tablespoon of butter.
            Pour the tomato-cashew puree back into the pan and cook for a few minutes.
            Add red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook the masala until it releases oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and mix it into the masala.
            Add the cashew nut paste and combine everything together.</li>
        <li>Add a little water to achieve your desired consistency. Allow the gravy to simmer for a few minutes.
            Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and add it to the gravy for flavor.
            Gently add the seared paneer cubes to the gravy and let them heat through.</li>
        <li>Finish with a sprinkle of garam masala and fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>
